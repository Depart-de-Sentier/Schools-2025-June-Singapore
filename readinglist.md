## ODYM Tutorials

Stefan Pauliuk [here](https://github.com/stefanpauliuk/dynamic_stock_model/blob/master/Doc/dynamic_stock_model_Documentation.ipynb) has an older ODYM tutorial which helpfully features a _'stock-driven model'_.
The tutorials currently on the ODYM documentation only have _'inflow-driven models'_.
